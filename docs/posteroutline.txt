motivation / goal: atmospheric turbulence

blurry, good cameras, oscillation, etc. prevents us from seeing the ideal images.

previous literature

what do we want to do? understand the underlying model of this turbulence.
method. starting point is Bake and Shake paper. Why are we using bake and shake?
jitter and how it might be related to turbulence if it's randomly distributed.
explain the bake step - tvr, perona malik, heat equation, etc. show some effects
of each. talk about numerical methods. reference image and some examples. then
go into the shake step - explain the idea behind it, newton's method, secant
method.

new part - j(y) = acos(by + c)

3d vectorial newton's method
